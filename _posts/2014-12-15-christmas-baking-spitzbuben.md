Being away from Germany for the second Christmas, we are keeping up some traditions
and decided to follow up with our baking efforts from last year.
The resulting "Plätzchen" taste delicious even in a summer christmas season.

The following recipe makes about 50 small cookies.

## Ingredients

* 300g plain flour
* 200g butter, at room temperature
* 100g almond flour
* 150g icing sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 tbsp vanilla essence
* 1 tbsp lemon zest
* jam for the filling

## Method

1. Mix all ingredients in a big bowl
2. Put the dough into the fridge for two hours
3. Roll the dough out flat, about 3mm thick
4. Use a shaped cutter to make the raw cookies (bottoms)
5. Use another, smaller cutter on half of the raw cookies (these will be the tops)
6. Preheat the oven to 180°C
7. Transfer the cookies to a tray and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until slightly brown
8. Put jam on the bottoms (watch out not to put too much on!), and combine with the tops, so that they stick to the bottoms
8. Lightly dust the cookies with icing sugar
