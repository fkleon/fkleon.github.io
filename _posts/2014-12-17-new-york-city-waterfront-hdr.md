Last year, when I was staying in Hoboken, I was greeted with a stunning skyline every day.
I've always wanted to experiment with HDR panorama shots, and used that opportunity.

This is the combination of three pictures, shot at f/9 exposed from 0.8 seconds to 5 seconds.
It shows the NYC and Jersey City waterfronts as seen from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken on 8th January 2014.

There is still some raw material of a panorama shot (about 80 pictures), which I haven't been able to edit and stitch yet.
I'll follow up with a new post soon!
